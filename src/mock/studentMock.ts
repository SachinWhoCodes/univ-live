    title: "The Decline of Indus Valley Civilization",
    content: `The Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, flourished between 2600 BCE and 1900 BCE. Recent archaeological and geological studies suggest that climate change played a crucial role in its decline.

The civilization depended heavily on the seasonal monsoons and the Ghaggar-Hakra river system. Around 2000 BCE, significant climate shifts led to weakening monsoons and the gradual drying of rivers. This resulted in decreased agricultural productivity, forcing populations to migrate eastward toward the Ganges basin.

While earlier theories emphasized Aryan invasion as the cause, modern research points to a more gradual decline driven by environmental factors. The cities were not destroyed suddenly but were slowly abandoned as water resources became scarce.`,
